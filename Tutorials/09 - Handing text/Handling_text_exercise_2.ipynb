Sheldon insists that he knows the show better than anyone, and keeps making various claims about the show, which neither of them know how to prove or disprove. The two of them have reached out to you ladies and gentlemen, as data scientists, to help them. You will be given the full script of the series, with information on the episode, the scene, the person saying each dialogue line, and the dialogue lines themselves.\n",

Assume that there are no two _named characters_ (i.e. characters who have actual names and aren't referred to generically as \"little girl\", \"grumpy grandpa\", etc.) with the same name, i.e. there are no two Sheldons, etc. Generate a list of recurrent characters who have more than 90 dialogue lines in total, and then take a look at the list you have. If you've done this correctly, you should have a list of 20 names. However, one of these is clearly not a recurrent character. Manually remove that one, and print out your list of recurrent characters. To remove that character, pay attention to the _named character_ assumption we gave you earlier on. **For all the subsequent questions, you must only keep the dialogue lines said by the recurrent characters in your list.**"
